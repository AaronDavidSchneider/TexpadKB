It would be very helpful if you could send us the preamble that causes the crash.  Additionally, could I ask you to send us the actual crash reports? Once you've synced you iPad, these can be found in one of the following directories on you Mac OS X:

(1) {your home directory}/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/{your device name}/texpadm.*
(2) {your home directory}/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/{your device name}.symbolicated/texpadm.*

The 2nd one is for new iPad and OS X systems. There should be some reports entitled texpadm. If you can send these to us, it would help a great deal.

Apple's detailed instructions for other platforms are here http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/ios_development_workflow/35-Distributing_Applications/distributing_applications.html
